     *  container are numbered from 0 to n-1 where n denotes the total number of vertices
     *  in the graph.
     *
     *  @note The vertices stored in this data structure use (in contrast to the remainder
     *  of classes provided by the htd framework) 0-based vertex names, i.e., the first
     *  vertex is assigned the ID 0. This allows for efficient storage and data handling
     *  based on arrays and vectors.
