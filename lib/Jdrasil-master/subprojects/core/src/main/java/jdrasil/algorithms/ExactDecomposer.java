/**
 * This class implements a hand-crafted algorithm that uses various of the other algorithms to compute an optimal
 * tree-decomposition. 
 * 
 * Using call() will invoke the following:
 *   a) the graph will be partitioned into its connected components, which are treated separately in the following
 *   b) the graph will be reduced by preprocessing
 *   c) and upper bound will be computed by stochastic-min fill
 *   d) a lower bound will be computed by minor-min-width
 *   e) if ub == lb the computation is done
 *   f) if n^ub is smaller then some threshold the optimal solution will be computed by the dynamic cops-and-robber game
 *   g) otherwise the optimal solution will be computed by a SAT-Encoding, either serial or parallel
 *   h) finally, all computed decompositions are merged
