/**
 * This class implements an incremental cardinality constraint for a given (fixed) formula 
 * and a given (fixed) set of variables.
 * A cardinality constraint is a constraint that states that at least lb and at most ub many variables from
 * the given set are allowed to be set to true.
 * 
 * This class is based on a sorting network (Batchers Odd-Even Mergesort): The idea is to sort the given set of variables,
 * a atLeast lb constraint then simply states that the n-lb'th element of the sorted output must be set to true, an atMost ub
 * constraint states that the n-ub-1'th element must be false.
 * 
 * Example: Say the variables we wish to constrain are 1 2 3 4, the network will generate auxiliary variables, say 8 10 11 9
 * (the model of these variables will be sorted, not the number of variables of course; many other variables and clauses will be added as well). * 
 * A model could now look like:
 * 
 * <p>1 2 3 4 \(\rightarrow\) 8 10 11 9</p>
 * <p>+ - + - \(\rightarrow\) -  -  + +</p>
 * <p>or</p>
 * <p>1 2 3 4 \(\rightarrow\) 8 10 11 9</p>
 * <p>+ + + - \(\rightarrow\) -  +  + +</p>
 * 
 * During initialization, the network will be computed and added to the formula. After this happened (once), one can add cardinality constraints
 * by adding unit clauses for the output gates, either over this class or directly. Note that, since these are unit clauses, cardinality constraints
 * can easily be used as assumptions, for instances for an binary search.
 * 
 * Note that a sorting network introduces a lot of auxiliary variables and clauses. This may not be worth it, if a single cardinality constraint is 
 * generated. In such cases, the @see BasicCardinalityEncoder should be used. If, however, many cardianlity constraints are generted incrementally, a
 * sorting network is worth its weight. 
 * Furthermore, a sorting network may outperform a more direct counter for "huge cardinality constraints", i.e., if k has a magnitude of n.
