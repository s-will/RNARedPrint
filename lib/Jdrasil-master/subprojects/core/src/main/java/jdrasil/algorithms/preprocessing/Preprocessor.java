/**
 * A Preprocessor is a function that maps an arbitrary input graph to a collection of "easier" graphs. 
 * Easier here is meant with respect to computing a tree decomposition and often just means "smaller", but 
 * could also reefer to adding structures to the graph that improve pruning potential.
 * 
 * This class models a preprocessor by providing the methods @see computeGraphs(), @see addbackTreeDecomposition(), @see glueDecompositions(), and
 * @see Preprocessor#getTreeDecomposition() . The first method represents the actual preprocessing and computes a collection of graphs from the input graph.
 * The following two methods can be used to add a tree decomposition of one of the graphs produced by the first method back, and to combine these
 * tree decompositions to one for the input graph. The last method is a getter for this decomposition.
