/**
 * An decreasing cardinality constraint is an "atMostK" constraint that is reduced between multiple calls 
 * of the SAT solver. In this sense, it is an incremental cardinality constraint as implemented by @see IncrementalCardinaltiyEncoder.
 * 
 * This class implements an sequential counter that can be reduced. The advantage (and different) to  @see IncrementalCardinaltiyEncoder
 * is that this class will introduce O(k*n) variables (vs O(n* log^2 n) of @see IncrementalCardinaltiyEncoder), which may be prefarable
 * for small k. Note that k in Jdrasil is often the tree width of the target graph and, thus, a small parameter.
