 * Partition Refinement is a data structure to represent a partition of a set

 * Let S be a set and P={S_1,...,S_n} be a partition of S. Let, furthermore, X be a subset of S.
 * The refinement of P with respect to X is defined as:
 *   refinement(P,X) = {S_1 cap X, S_1 minus X, ..., S_n cap X, S_n minus X}.
 * 
 * This operation can be computed in time O(|X|) independently of |S| and n.
