/**
 * A matching in a graph \(G=(V,E)\) is a subset of the edges \(M\subseteq E\) such that for every vertex \(v\in V\) we have 
 * \(|\{\,e\mid e\in M\wedge v\in e\,\}|\leq 1\). A matching is maximal if we can not increase it by adding any edge. It is a maximum matching,
 * if there is no bigger matching in the graph, and it is perfect if every vertex is matched.
 * 
 * This class greedily computes a maximal matching, i.e., it is not guaranteed that it is a maximum matching.
 * The matching is represented as map from vertices to vertices, i.e., a vertex is mapped to the vertex it is matched with.
