/**
 * The {k-neighbor / k-path}-improved graph \(H\) of a given graph \(G\) is obtained by adding an edge between all
 * non adjacent vertices that have at least k {common neighbors / vertex disjoint paths}. A crucial lemma states that
 * adding these edges will not increase the tree width. Hence, we can compute a lower bound on the tree width of
 * \(G\) by computing lower bounds on increasing improved graphs of \(G\). In this way, improved graphs can be used
 * to improve the performance of any lower bound algorithm.
 *
 * This class implements the improve graph trick to improve some implemented lower bound algorithms. The implementation
 * is based on Bodlaender and Koster: Treewidth Computations II
